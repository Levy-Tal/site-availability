# Why Site Availability Matters for SRE Teams

## The SRE Challenge: Measuring What Matters

One of the most fundamental responsibilities of Site Reliability Engineering is **measuring service availability** and ensuring services meet their Service Level Objectives (SLOs). However, tracking availability across a large company's infrastructure presents significant challenges that can overwhelm even experienced SRE teams.

## The Complexity Problem

### Scale and Fragmentation

Modern enterprises operate **hundreds or thousands of microservices**, each with different:

- **Technology stacks** (Java, Python, Go, Node.js)
- **Deployment patterns** (containers, VMs, serverless)
- **Monitoring approaches** (logs, metrics, traces)
- **Team ownership** and access requirements

### Inconsistent Availability Definition

**"Available" isn't binary.** A service might return HTTP 200 but deliver:

- Wrong data
- Unacceptable latency
- Degraded functionality

Different components require different Service Level Indicators (SLIs):

- **Web APIs**: Success rate + response time
- **Databases**: Query error rate + connection health
- **Message queues**: Processing rate + backlog size
- **External dependencies**: Third-party SLA compliance

### Organizational Silos

- **Different teams** own different services
- **Varying permissions** and access patterns
- **Inconsistent labeling** and metrics standards
- **Fragmented dashboards** across multiple tools

## How Site Availability Solves These Challenges

### üéØ **Unified Service Discovery**

- **Multi-source aggregation**: Pull availability data from Prometheus, HTTP endpoints, and external APIs
- **Automatic labeling**: Consistent metadata across all services regardless of source
- **Team-based filtering**: Show only the services your team owns or cares about

### üìä **Consistent Availability Metrics**

- **Standardized SLIs**: HTTP success rates, response times, and custom business metrics
- **Flexible definitions**: Configure what "available" means for each service type
- **Historical tracking**: Trend analysis and SLO compliance reporting

### üîç **Intelligent Aggregation**

- **Geographic grouping**: View availability by region, datacenter, or environment
- **Service hierarchies**: Roll up component availability to business-critical services
- **Smart filtering**: Focus on production services, critical dependencies, or failing components

### üö® **Actionable Alerting**

- **SLO-based alerts**: Get notified when error budgets are at risk
- **Noise reduction**: Alert on patterns, not individual blips
- **Context-rich notifications**: Know which team to contact and what might be affected

### üè¢ **Enterprise-Ready**

- **RBAC integration**: Respect existing access controls and permissions
- **Multi-tenant**: Support multiple teams and environments in one deployment
- **Audit trail**: Track who accessed what and when for compliance

## The Bottom Line

**Site Availability transforms availability monitoring from a reactive burden into a proactive advantage.**

Instead of spending hours manually correlating metrics across disparate tools, SRE teams get:

- ‚úÖ **Single source of truth** for service availability
- ‚úÖ **Consistent SLO tracking** across all services
- ‚úÖ **Faster incident response** with centralized visibility
- ‚úÖ **Data-driven capacity planning** with historical trends
- ‚úÖ **Improved stakeholder communication** with clear availability reports
